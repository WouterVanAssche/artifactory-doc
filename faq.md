### What is Artifactory?

Artifactory is a binary repository manager created by JFrog.

### What can a binary repository manager be used for?

It allows to store binary data with version control. Such data are typically
the result of a build process (e.g. compiled executables, or a Docker image),
in which case they are also referred to as 'artifacts'.

A binary repository manager is complementary to source code management tools
such as Git, which are well suited for handling text files but not for binary
data.
